        <h1>AntLens Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 15, 2026</p>
        
        <p>Welcome to AntLens. We value your privacy. This policy explains how we collect, use, and handle your information when you use our app.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We adhere to a "data minimization" principle. We only process data necessary to provide the ant identification service.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera & Photo Library:</strong> To identify ant species, we require access to your camera or photo library. Photos you upload are processed solely for the purpose of analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> We may collect non-personally identifiable information, such as device model and iOS version, to help us debug and improve app performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Data Processing & Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>To provide accurate identification, we utilize advanced AI technology. Your image data is processed as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Gemini API:</strong> We use Google's generative AI services to analyze the visual features of the ants in your photos. Data sent to this service is encrypted during transmission and is not used by us for advertising purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not permanently store your uploaded photos on our servers. Once the analysis is complete, the image data is discarded from the processing pipeline.</p>

        <h2>3. Your Rights & Data Storage</h2>
        <p>AntLens does not require user account registration. Most app data (such as your scan history) is stored locally on your device. You can delete all data associated with the app simply by uninstalling AntLens from your device.</p>

        <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

        <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
